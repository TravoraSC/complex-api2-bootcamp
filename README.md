# ðŸ“Š Project: Complex API 2

### Goal: Use data returned from one api to make a request to another api and display the data returned

### How to submit your code for review:

I completed the challenge: 5 - I did use two APIs but one of them didn't require a fetch which was convenient.
I feel good about my code: 3 - The JS could have been much cleaner and simpler.
